##  Overview

This project was made for learning purposes with new features currently under development.

This project aimed to develop a desktop application allowing users to store passwords in a secure way. 

Utilized client - server architecture with TypeSript and Electron for the frontend. 
The server have been built with Java Spring Boot, currently under development phase.

Despite the client - server architecture, the application store passwords in a decentralised way, therefore both the server and the client are running locally on the user's device.
